Welcome to Model-SA.   

The code before you is a simple solution for **K-Modem Problem Illumination** (Problem description available below) and it is the result of two students' bachelor's project (Check the contributors).  
The code itself is written in __Java__ (Requirements are listed below) and it is heavily dependent on the JTS geometry library.   

This repository contains   
- The Projects Source   
- Documentation and Screenshots   
- Test Cases   
- A Randomly generated dataset of simple geometries   

**Warning!**   
The following readme file **Dose Not** contain detailed information about the problem.   
For further information on technical details of the problem, experiments and theire results, check out [Technical Details](TechincalDetails.md)

## Problem Description
### Original K-Modem Description
For the original description of K-Modem problem, check out the [Technical Details](TechincalDetails.md/#problem_description).   
### A Subset of the K-Modem Problem
_**Note**: This is a subset of the original K-Modem illumination problem and it is the actual problem that the code is written for. With little adjustments (check [Technical Details](TechincalDetails.md/#problem_description)) the code can solve the original problem as well._  
  

Let _P_ be a simple polygon consist of an outter shell (the outter walls) and zero or more holes (check the screenshot bellow). Given the number of k-modems available _q_, and the penetration rate _k_, what are the best cordinates to put the k-modems on, such that the maximum area of the polygon is covered.   
Another custom variation of the problem comes from the asumption that the k-modems can have signal confliction. If any point is covered by more than one k-modem, signal confliction happen and the point is not covered anymore.
