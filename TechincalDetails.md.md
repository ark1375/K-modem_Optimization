## Problem Description
#### Original Description
The K-Modem problem is actually not a stand-alone problem itself. It is a variation of an old, computational geometry problem called **Art Gallery Illumination Probelm** that consists on _finding the minimum number of light sources needed to illuminate a simple polygon (eg. map of a gallery)_<sup>[1](#credits)</sup>.    
One of the famous variations of the problem is **K-Modem Illumination Problem**.  
For a non-negative number _k_, a _k-modem_ is a wireless deice that can penetrate _k_ "walls". Let _L_ be a set of _n_ line segments (or lines) in the plane. A k-modem __illuminates all__ points _p_ of the plane such that the interior of the line segment joining p and the k-modem intersects at most _k_ elements of _L_. In general, k-modem illumination problems consist on finding the minimum number of k-modems necessary to illuminate a certain subset of the plane, for a given L.
